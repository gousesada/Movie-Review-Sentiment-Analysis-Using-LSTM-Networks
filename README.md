# Movie-Review-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-LSTM-Networks
Overview:
This project uses LSTM networks to perform sentiment analysis on text data, classifying it as either positive or negative. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, with data preprocessing handled through tokenization and padding.

Key Features:
LSTM-based architecture for sentiment classification.
Text preprocessing with tokenization and sequence padding.
Implements early stopping to prevent overfitting.
Supports custom datasets for other text classification tasks.

Technologies:
Python
TensorFlow & Keras
Pandas
Scikit-learn
